# 👋 Hi, I’m Camila Duarte  

**Industrial Engineer | End-to-End Data, Financial Governance & Accounting-Aware Analytics**

I specialize in connecting **business operations, data platforms and accounting logic** to ensure that information is **consistent, traceable, auditable and decision-ready**, particularly in regulated environments.

My work focuses on the **full information lifecycle**:  
from how data is generated in core business processes,  
to how it travels across systems and data platforms,  
to how it is validated, controlled and transformed into **financial and management information** used for strategic decision making.

This GitHub is a **public experimentation space** where I prototype governance frameworks, analytical models and automation-ready solutions using **synthetic or public data**, with a strong focus on clarity, traceability and real-world applicability.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔎 Analyze how **business events generate structured financial data**
- 🧩 Design **end-to-end analytical and control architectures**
- 🛡️ Embed **traceability and validation layers** into data flows
- 🤖 Build **automation-ready prototypes** that reduce manual risk and improve control
- 📊 Translate complex data journeys into **clear, reliable and audit-ready insights**
